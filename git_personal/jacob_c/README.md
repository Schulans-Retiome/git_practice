# Introduction
> Note: this is a work in progress!

Hello, World!

This is Kevin James Bernabe's repository. Feel free to import packages in here. Do not steal code. Use it to learn, experiment, and help you out with your own code by importing the packages or making it a submodule.

> P.S. This is actually Jacob, I just stole Kevin's README.md. Disregard the message above. Unauthorized access is discouraged, lest undesirable consequences follow. I will edit my introduction when I find the time.
